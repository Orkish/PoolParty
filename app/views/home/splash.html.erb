        If New York’s bars and restaurants seem crowded at night, consider this: during the day, commuters from the other boroughs and outside the city nearly double Manhattan’s population, from 1.6 million to 3.1 million.

        Over all, the net gain in people due to commuting swells New York City’s weekday population by about 608,000, or nearly as many people as live in Baltimore. (The citywide increase is smaller than the Manhattan figure because so many city residents outside Manhattan leave their home borough to work.)

        Nearly 92 percent of workers who live in New York work somewhere within the five boroughs – a higher proportion than in any other big city in the country. The 608,000 weekday population rise represents a 8 percent gain — far smaller, though, than the double-digit increases recorded in some Southern and Western cities, including Houston, Dallas and San Diego.

        Houston is second in net daytime population change due to workers, adding just over 400,000, according to census figures released Thursday. (The census’s American Community Survey asks about commuting to work patterns, not people who cross county lines to visit for other purposes.)

        About 270,000 New Yorkers work outside the city, while 2.9 million people both live and work there.

        Every borough registers a decline in daytime population because of workplace patterns except Manhattan (Queens loses 353,000, the most; Staten Island loses the highest percentage, 18 percent). In all but Manhattan and Brooklyn, fewer than half the workers live and work in the same county.

        More than 80 percent of Manhattanites live and work in their home borough. Of the 826,000 workers who live in Manhattan, 696,000 also work there.
